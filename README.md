##Guitar Chord Detection using Signal Processing##

This project is designed to detect guitar chords based on 1-dimensional signal processing of frequency data. The model classifies chords by analyzing frequency characteristics using techniques like filtering, normalization, and feature extraction. The dataset used in this project is a simulated set of guitar chord signals, including chords such as C Major, G Major, A Minor, and E Minor.


#Guitar Chord Detection using Signal Processing

This project is designed to detect guitar chords based on 1-dimensional signal processing of frequency data. The model classifies chords by analyzing frequency characteristics using techniques like filtering, normalization, and feature extraction. The dataset used in this project is a simulated set of guitar chord signals, including chords such as C Major, G Major, A Minor, and E Minor. The main objective of this project is to classify guitar chords based on signal data. Using signal processing techniques such as filtering, normalization, and feature extraction, the model is able to detect and classify chords with high accuracy. This project uses synthetic guitar chord signals and processes them to classify different chords.
